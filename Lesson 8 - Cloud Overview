AWS Cloud Practitoner Notes:

EC2 - Virtual Server....

- General Purpose machines
- Compute Optimized
- Memory Optimized - Hight RAM - Databases
- Accelerated Computing - has GPU - ML/AI
- Storage Optimized - data warehouing

a = ARM core
i= intel cilocn
n= fast networlking

https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types


EC2 AWS Pay - 
On-Demand - PAYG
Spot Instance - PAYG but can be taken away - flexible
Compute Saving Plan - 66% off.....subscription 
Dedicated - Licences or socket-based
Dedicated Instance - required for WIN10 licences


EC2 Auto Scaling - 
Schedule for peak
Set Min and Desired
Scale as needed
Smart scheduling



Elastic Load Balancing - 
USes auto-scaling


Auto scale vs Load Balancing
--- remove 

Load balances forwarded to AutoScaller




Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS) - 
Get subscribed notifications via email/SMSs etc

Amazon Simple Queue Server (SQS) - 
Notification ... trnastion ... notification



AWS Lambda - 
Serverless ..... no requirement for the server just run code....
trigger code automatically...



EventBridge - scheduled event and runs


ECS - Docker Serice
API docker enabld
Containers - 


EKS - Kubernetes service
aka K8


AWS Fargate - runs ECS and EKS pay only resources use!

Reserved contract lengths: 1 + 3 years




Global infra and reliability - 

i.e Data centres

Availability zones and edge services

Region = at least 2 availability zones...

AZ - a cluster of data centres - at least 1 data centre


CloudFront - global delivery network

Edge Services - 

AWS Outposts  -  run AWS equipment on PREM. - legal requirement



Provides speed > availability

proximity to customers and compliance



Interact with AWS Services - 
via EC2

API requests

Console
Command Line







Networking:

VPC - Virtual Private Cloud = isolated network on AWS

Virtual Private Gateway = VPN

Private Subnet  = databases

AWS Direct Connect = dedicate on-prem to cloud.





Firewalls:
N ACLs are applied at subnet level
stateless - explict rules for in/out trafic

Security Group inside VPC and Public subnet
Low lever
These are stateful - auto-allow back 
by default block all inbound
Tied to an instance


Interact with AWS Global network via FQDN



AWS Route 53 - AWS DNS Service
AWS Managed Service

Send to CloudFront > Load Ballencer > EC2 or send to Route 53







STORAGE:


S3 bucker = storage
Simple storage solution

Elastic file system - shared storage - EFS, FSx ( for windows)


Block storage = block map
Like a HDD
Attached to EC2
 - comes in instance store - ephemeral storage.... none volatile memoryexpressphysicall data) - ingest data - data processing - RAM
 - Elastic block store volumes - presence - HDD - OS - APP data

EBS snapshot
Incremental = all changes since last backup


Object-based storage - immutable - 
Write once read many

= S3 buckets
Regional 
Public 
Store Class - 

Classes:
S3 Standard - always leave frequent access stores in min 3 avabilety zones
S3 Srarned  - IA- less cost - infrequant access
S3 OneZore - less avablity....retrieval expensive
S3 Glacia (archiving) - flex and Deep archive......12 hours to get.
S3 Glacia Deep Archiveere compliances



File Storage - shared block-level
Elastic File System - Linux
FSx for Windows
Multpul region


accross Avabilty Zones...run on reganal level



AWS Database:

Types: 

relational and non-elationalshal

Relational
Priamy key and forign key

Key - name
Value - Tom


The key stored: 
Key (title) Value (a record)


SQL 




Amazon Relational Database (RDS)
- stre
- crypt
Engines: OracleSQL server, OS: MySQL, Postgres, MariaDB



AWS Arura - is a non-relational database



Amazon DynamoDB - key-value pair database .... serverless ....auto-scale


AWS Database Migration


AWS Redshift - data warehouse

AWS Document DB - mongo DB

AWS Nepture - GraphQL

AWS QLDB - see previous DVLA tract old records of cards


AWS Managed Blockchain
AWS ElastiCache - Redisash data services
Amazon DynmoDB Accelatore - speed service







SECURITY:

IAM = tempary access 

Identity management - 

roles - 
1 - cross country administration
2 - assume a role
3 - Federated users
4 - 


Permissions
Multi-Factor Auth
policy  - Least privilege follow - written in JSON

SCP



Compliance 
- AWS Artifacts - on-demand reports
- Accept agreements 



AWS WAF (Web application firewall):
Profect front end


AWS Sheild - DDOS protect
Sheild basic - free
Sheild - advanced - not free


AWS Inspector - watch EC2 fix security issues....is the patch up to date?


AWS Key manamgnet service (KMS) creates/delete keys



AWS Guard Duty - logging of accounts ...logging...




MONITORING:

AWS CloudWatch - 

Up/down

Create alarms

Create actions..


AWS CloudTrain - Audit
event tracking ... trackback
Event History ....dashboard



AWS Trusted Advisor - best practice - enterprise/business support 
Allows for:
- cost operation
- performance
- fault tolerance




PRICING:


Pay as you go
Pay less when you reserve
Pay plus with a column with discount


Consolidating Billing - reduce cost....11000 accounts 1 bill.
Itemised

Budgets set at service level...account level or project level#

Contact Technical Accounts manager > Enterprise plan



Cost Plan:
Business > Enterprise

Basic/Trail = free




AWS Market Place
- App store for AWS





MIGRATION AND INNOVATION:

Steps:
1 - rehosting build on-prem to cloud....lift and shift (VM > EC2)..
2 - Reactutect - Rebuild to the cloud ....cloud-native ...v2
3 - Repurchase - use SaaS instead of full server
4 - Retain - Legacy/unsupported 
5 - Retire


AWS Snowcone - Small rugged device ... feature 8TB data
AWS Snowball device -80TB 
AWS Snowmobile - 100PB storage




Innovation
AI
ML
Serverless applications




Well-Architecture Framework - 
1 - Operational Excellence ... assume all going to fail...document... frequent, small changes regularly.
2- Security...automate...encrypt data at rest and on the move
3 - Reliability...
4 - Performances efficacy
5 - Cost optimisation
6 - Sustavtilty
